# AppDiff

AppDiff is an extension of [LibScout](https://github.com/reddr/LibScout), a light-weight and effective static analysis tool to detect third-party libraries in Android/Java apps.
AppDiff finds code changes across two versions of an app, i.e. changes in methods with the same signature, added/deleted classes/packages.



##  AppDiff 101

 * AppDiff requires Java 1.8 or higher and can be build with Gradle.
 * Generate a runnable jar with the gradle wrapper <i>gradlew</i> (Linux/MacOS) or <i>gradlew.bat</i> (Windows), by invoking it with the <i>build</i> task, e.g. <i>./gradlew build</i><br>
   The <i>AppDiff.jar</i> is output to the <i>build/libs</i> directory.
 * Some less frequently changing options can be configured via LibScout's config file [LibScout.toml](config/LibScout.toml).
 * Most LibScout modules require an Android SDK (jar) to distinguish app code from framework code (via the -a switch).
Refer to <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">https://developer.android.com/studio/</a> for download instructions.
 * By default, LibScout logs to stdout. Use the -d switch to redirect output to files. The -m switch disables any text output. Depending on the operation mode (see below), LibScout's results can be written to disk in JSON format or JAVA serialization.
 * Repo structure in a nutshell:<br>

### Application Version Diff (-o diff)

AppDiff takes two (subsequent) versions of the same app and reports on any changes in the bytecode, these includes changes in methods with the same signature, addition/removal of methods/classes/packages.
The log output further visualizes the changes in a diff tree. All changes are additionally written to a json file (-j switch).

<pre>java -jar LibScout.jar -o diff -a <i>android_sdk_jar</i> -j <i>json_dir</i> <i>path_to_apk_old_version<i> <i>path_to_apk_new_version<i> </pre>
